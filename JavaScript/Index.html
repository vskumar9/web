Let's get started. Accessing DOM elements with JavaScript is a key 
skill for web development. As we know, the Document Object Model is 
a tree-like structure that represents a HTML elements of a webpage. 
You can use JavaScript to access these elements in various ways. To 
get started, you will need to know how to select an element. Let's 
look at some commonly used DOM selectors in JavaScript. Forces document.
getElementById. It returns the element with the specific ID. Let's see
 how we can use that. Let's go to the VS Code and here I have index.
 html file. I can delete this one, and let's create a very basic boiler 
 plate using this shortcut. You can see we have a title document. Let's 
 make it DOM. In the body, we can say h1 of DOM selectors. If I click on 
 "Save", you can see that we have the output on the webpage. We're talking 
 about document.getElementById. Here we can have a div, and let's say, 
 Hello world. What we can do is we can create one more div, and we can 
 just say, Hi there. The first div, we'll just give it an Id of let's say 
 Hello. Out of all these elements, we want to access the first div of id
  hello. Here I will script tag and I will say document, or we can say 
  console.log document.getElementbyId, and we can pass the ID name here. 
  The id is hello, we have to pass it in quotes. If I click on "Save", let's 
  go to Inspect, let's go to Console and you can see that we have got this 
  div. It's cool. We have got this on the basis of id. The next one is document.
  getElementsByClassName. The little difference you will see here that it is 
  getElements. Earlier one was getElement, we can only get one element out of 
  it, but here we can get multiple elements by class name. Returns a collection 
  of all the elements that the specified class name. For example, if I create a 
  unordered list and inside that I have li class let's say green. We can say item 
  1, and we can create one more li or let's say four li's out of which only two 
  has the class of green, so we can remove these options here.

  If I click on "Save" and if I rather than doing this, what I can do is I can say 
let items, I can also put them in a variable. I can say document.getElementsByClassName, 
and we can pass the class name as green. Then we can say console.log (items). 
If I click on "Save", if I go here, if I refresh, you will see that we get an HTML 
collection. It has an li structure, and we get two li items that has the class of 
green color. Let's go to the next one. Next one is document.getElementsByTagName. 
Here also, we can get multiple collections, or you can say it returns a collection 
of all the elements with the specified tag name. We have multiple li items here. 
What we can do is, let's just copy paste this, instead of document.getElementsByClassName, we 
can see getElementsByTagName. Here, the tag name is li, we have to pass it like 
this. If I click on "Save", if I go here, let's refresh, you can see that we're 
getting all the li items, so this is now a collection of four elements.

Next one is document.querySelector. It returns the first element that matches the 
specified CSS selector. For example, we have here li and two class names are green. 
What I will do is I will say let item. Let's comment this out, and we will use query 
selected here, and I will say I want to get the item that has a class of green. 
We have to add a CSS selector as well, that is dot for class. You may notice that 
two of the li classes have class green. If I do console.log item, it returns only 
the first li element that has a text of item one. It should always returns the first 
element that matches the specified CSS selector. But then if you want to get all 
the classes, or you can say all the li items that has a class of green, one way 
was to use getElementsByClassName. The other method that is the last one, that is 
document.querySelectorAll. Here, what we can do is we can say querySelectorAll, 
and we are passing the same green class here. Now if I do items, if I click on 
"Save", you will see that it returns a collection of all the items that match the 
specified CSS selector. Let's summarize this. We know that the Document Object 
Model is a tree-like structure that represents the HTML elements of a webpage. 
JavaScript provides various methods to access these elements, such as getElementById
, getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName, querySelector, and querySelectorAll. 
Once we have a reference when element, you can modify its attributes, content, 
and style, or create new elements using other methods that we would be looking at 
in a separate video. With these tools, you can create dynamic and interactive 
webpages that responds to user input and update in real time. This is all for 
this video. In the next video, we will see how to manipulate DOM using JavaScrip
