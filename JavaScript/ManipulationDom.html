<!-- 
let's get started. When we talk about manipulating the DOM with JavaScript, 
we mean that it can be used to dynamically modify the elements on webpage 
without having to reload the entire page. For example, suppose we have a 
webpage with a button and a paragraph element. You can use JavaScript to 
change the text inside the paragraph element when the button is clicked without 
having to reload the entire page. To do this, you first need to select the 
element you want to modify using a DOM selector. A DOM selector is a method 
that allows you to select an element or group of elements on a webpage. There 
are several different DOM selectors you can use and we have covered them in 
the previous video. Once you have selected the element you want to modify, 
you can then access and modify its properties. Properties are characteristics 
of an element that you can change, such as its text, content, attributes and 
styles. Let's see some examples. So now I am here in my VS code and I have an 
indexed HTML with its boilerplate ready. I also have a script tag where we can 
write our JavaScript code. And this is getting outputted in the webpage. This is 
a very basic HTML page and this is what is called as DOM, you can say console.
log and there is one more keyword that is console.dir that gives you a directory. 
Or you can say properties or methods that you can use to manipulate the DOM. 
If I say console.dir document, let's click on Save. Let's go to inspect and 
console, you can see that it lists down all the properties and methods that you 
can use. We have URL, location, background, color, baseURI, all elements. We have 
a lot of things here. You can go through them and you can use whatever you want 
to use as per your use cases. So if I want to get the domain, I can say, Console.
log and we can just log the domain, so we can say log(document.domain). 
So if I click on Save, you will see that we get domain, that is 127.0.0.1, in 
this case. If I want to get the URL, I can just comment this and I can say 
document.URL. If I click on Save, you will see that we get the URL of our webpage. 
If you want to get title, we can get the title, or let's say if you want 
to change the title, we can say document.title and we can make it equal to let's 
say dom manipulation.

So if I click on Save, it should be basically a string. If I click on Save, you 
can see that the title has changed to DOM Manipulation here. Similarly, if you 
want to get body, you can say document.body, it gives you the body of your entire 
webpage. If you want to get head, you can say document.head, you can do a lot of 
stuff. Let's see how we can add a text. So first you want to select the element, 
so we want to select this body element. So we can say here let's say const and 
const body = document.body. We have selected the body element, then we can use 
method like body.append or append child, and we can just append a text here, 
let's say hello. If I click on Save, you will see that hello comes here on the 
webpage. Let's say we want to create a new element, so what we can do is we can 
go here and we can just create a div. So let's create a variable that is const 
div and we can say document.create element, so this is the method you can use 
to create an element. Which element we want to create? We want to create a div, 
so I can write div, at this point, you can write h3, you can write p tag, 
whatever the element you want to create, you can just mention it here. And then 
if I say console.log(div) let's comment the others.

Let's target the body only at this point. If I click on Save, you will see that 
in the console we are getting div. But is this div actually getting added? Let's 
find out, so we can go to our element section. This is our HTML inside the body. 
You can see that there is only h1, so where is this div gone? Actually what we 
have done is we have just created an empty div, we have not yet added it into 
our document. So for that, we can use append child. Before that you want to 
add some text to a div. So you can say div.innerText, and let's say we are 
adding JavaScript text here, and then we want to add the div inside the body. 
So I can say body.append or append child and we can add a div. Now, if I click 
on save you will see we have a div with text of JavaScript. This is how you can 
create the elements. Let's also see how we can remove them.

So if you want to say body and you can say body.remove child and we can pass div 
here, so if I click on Save you will see that that particular div is gone. 
This is how you can remove, there is one more method that is directly removed. 
So you just have to target that div and you have to say div.remove. That's it, 
it would also remove this particular div.

So we have seen couple of methods here, that is inner text append and append 
child and remove as well. Let's summarize this. So accessing DOM elements with 
JavaScript allows you to select and modify elements on a web page without having 
to reload the entire page. You can use DOM selectors to select elements and 
then modify their properties such as text, content attributes, styles and child 
elements and then so on.
